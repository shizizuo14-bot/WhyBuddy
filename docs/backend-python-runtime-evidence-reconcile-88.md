# Backend Python Runtime Evidence Reconcile 88

## Scope

This report reconciles two queue tasks that are marked `DONE_REVIEWED` in the
latest queue outcome file against files that are visible in current `HEAD`.
It does not add business behavior, runtime bridges, schema changes, auth
semantics, permission semantics, audit behavior, or A2A behavior.

Current repository head used for this pass:

- `66677676b941a0a923ea422bd22792d1d4f28cf6`
- `66677676 chore(agent-loop): plan backend python 88 queue`

Queue outcome source used for status only:

- `../../.agent-loop/queue-outcomes.json`
- Last file timestamp observed in the main repo: `2026-06-22 03:59:48`

Queue green status is treated as a review signal, not as runtime or production
evidence by itself.

## Queue Outcome Reconcile

| Task | Queue status | Queue outcome | Run id | Updated at | Evidence posture |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `backend-python-auth-permission-audit-runtime-90` | `DONE_REVIEWED` | `done` | `2026-06-21T17-50-28-952Z` | `2026-06-21T17:55:58.608Z` | Mixed. Permission check has bounded runtime-boundary evidence; auth/session, rate limit, and audit event runtime paths are missing in current `HEAD`. |
| `backend-python-a2a-stream-runtime-boundary-90` | `DONE_REVIEWED` | `done` | `2026-06-21T17-55-58-653Z` | `2026-06-21T18:06:43.872Z` | Contract-only for stream. Current `HEAD` has A2A contract/service projection evidence, but the stream runtime gate paths are missing. |

Historical queue entries for the narrower auth/session, permission-check,
permission-rate-limit, and audit-event runtime boundary tasks still include
old `HALT_HUMAN` or crashed states. The umbrella 90 task does not erase those
history rows unless the corresponding current `HEAD` files are visible.

## Auth, Permission, Audit Evidence Matrix

| Slice | Current `HEAD` evidence | Missing runtime paths | Commit evidence | Count posture |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Auth/session runtime boundary | Contract tests exist: `slide-rule-python/tests/test_auth_session_contract.py`, `server/tests/auth-session-python-contract.test.ts`. Node auth route and middleware remain visible at `server/routes/auth.ts` and `server/auth/middleware.ts`. | `slide-rule-python/tests/test_auth_session_runtime_boundary.py`, `server/tests/auth-session-runtime-boundary.test.ts` | Contract files trace to `6d9194f8 Advance backend Python migration slices`. No current commit evidence for the missing runtime-boundary paths because the files are absent. | `contract-only`; runtime evidence is `evidence-missing`. Do not count as auth/session production migration. |
| Permission check runtime boundary | Python runtime test exists: `slide-rule-python/tests/test_permission_check_runtime_boundary.py`. Node runtime mapper test exists: `server/permission/check-engine-python-runtime.test.ts`. Shared contract exists: `shared/permission/contracts.ts`. Python evaluator lives in `slide-rule-python/middlewares/auth.py`. | None among the gate-named permission-check runtime paths. This still does not cover permission route management or production persistence. | `61097ed0 feat(backend-python): add permission check runtime boundary` | Bounded `runtime-boundary` for permission check only. Do not count as full permission production migration. |
| Permission rate-limit runtime boundary | Contract tests exist: `slide-rule-python/tests/test_permission_rate_limit_contract.py`, `server/permission/rate-limiter-python-contract.test.ts`. Existing Node limiter remains at `server/permission/rate-limiter.ts`. | `slide-rule-python/tests/test_permission_rate_limit_runtime_boundary.py`, `server/permission/rate-limiter-python-runtime.test.ts` | Contract files trace to `6d9194f8 Advance backend Python migration slices`. No current commit evidence for the missing runtime-boundary paths because the files are absent. | `contract-only`; runtime evidence is `evidence-missing`. Do not count as rate-limit runtime migration. |
| Audit event runtime boundary | Contract tests exist: `slide-rule-python/tests/test_audit_event_contract.py`, `server/tests/audit-event-python-contract.test.ts`. Shared contract exists: `shared/audit/contracts.ts`. Node audit collectors/routes remain under `server/audit/*` and `server/routes/audit.ts`. | `slide-rule-python/tests/test_audit_event_runtime_boundary.py`, `server/tests/audit-event-python-runtime.test.ts` | Contract files trace to `6d9194f8 Advance backend Python migration slices`. No current commit evidence for the missing runtime-boundary paths because the files are absent. | `contract-only`; runtime evidence is `evidence-missing`. Do not count as audit production sink or audit runtime migration. |

Conclusion for `backend-python-auth-permission-audit-runtime-90`:
the queue row is reviewed, but current `HEAD` only supports counting the
permission-check slice as a bounded runtime boundary. Auth/session, rate-limit,
and audit-event runtime claims must be downgraded to `contract-only` with
runtime `evidence-missing`.

## A2A Stream Evidence Matrix

| Slice | Current `HEAD` evidence | Missing runtime paths | Commit evidence | Count posture |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| A2A stream contract projection | Python service projection exists at `slide-rule-python/services/a2a_runtime.py`. Python contract tests exist at `slide-rule-python/tests/test_a2a_runtime_contract.py` and cover `stream_chunk`, cancel, and failure envelopes without real external agents. Node contract tests exist at `server/routes/__tests__/a2a-python-runtime-contract.test.ts`. Shared validator exists at `shared/a2a-protocol.ts`. | `slide-rule-python/tests/test_a2a_stream_runtime_boundary.py`, `server/routes/__tests__/a2a-python-stream-runtime.test.ts` | `3eca0bd4 feat(backend-python): add a2a runtime contract`; `7e34c2a9 feat(backend-python): add a2a invoke runtime bridge` | `contract-only` for stream. It is not a current stream runtime bridge and not production stream migration. |
| A2A Node stream transport | Node route/client/server files exist: `server/routes/a2a.ts`, `server/core/a2a-client.ts`, `server/core/a2a-server.ts`. | The Python stream runtime tests above remain absent. | Older Node A2A files predate this reconcile. | Node-owned stream transport. Do not count as Python runtime/production evidence. |

Conclusion for `backend-python-a2a-stream-runtime-boundary-90`:
current `HEAD` has useful A2A envelope and contract evidence, but not the
gate-named stream runtime tests. The stream part must stay `contract-only`
until those paths or equivalent current `HEAD` runtime evidence are present.

## Gate Path Reconcile

The task-required gate key is `runtimeEvidenceReconcile88Gates`:

```text
node agent-loop/src/check-mojibake.js {{taskFile}} docs/backend-python-runtime-evidence-reconcile-88.md agent-loop/tasks/sliderule-python-migration-status.md agent-loop/tasks/backend-python-auth-permission-audit-runtime-90.md agent-loop/tasks/backend-python-a2a-stream-runtime-boundary-90.md
```

This gate is a mojibake scan only. It confirms report/task files are readable;
it does not prove auth, permission, audit, A2A runtime, or production wiring.
The auth/permission/audit 90 and A2A stream 90 gate command paths are not
reused as current runtime evidence because several paths named by those gates
are absent in `HEAD`.

## Counting Decision

- Count `backend-python-auth-permission-audit-runtime-90` only as:
  - permission check: bounded `runtime-boundary`
  - auth/session: `contract-only` plus runtime `evidence-missing`
  - permission rate limit: `contract-only` plus runtime `evidence-missing`
  - audit event: `contract-only` plus runtime `evidence-missing`
- Count `backend-python-a2a-stream-runtime-boundary-90` as `contract-only`
  for stream evidence.
- Do not count either task as full runtime migration, production migration, or
  a reason to move the overall backend migration percentage to 90%.
- Do not treat proxy/contract tests, queue `DONE_REVIEWED`, or a mojibake gate
  as production evidence.

## Review Confirmation

This reconcile does not hide the missing files. The visible permission-check
runtime boundary is separated from the missing auth/session, rate-limit, audit,
and A2A stream runtime paths. No contract-only or proxy-only slice is promoted
to runtime or production status.
