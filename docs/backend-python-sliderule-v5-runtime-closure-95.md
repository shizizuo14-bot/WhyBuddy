# Backend Python SlideRule V5 Runtime Closure 95 Audit

## Scope

This report audits the SlideRule V5 main runtime chain at the 95-stage
closure boundary. It is limited to current `HEAD` evidence, queue outcome
status, the 89/90 stage audit docs, and the gate-named tests for this task.

Current repository baseline:

- `91e4c01b chore(agent-loop): plan backend python 95 queue`
- Worktree path checked: `.worktrees/migration-queue`
- Requested worktree-local `.agent-loop/queue-outcomes.json`: not present
- Queue outcome source used for status context: `../../.agent-loop/queue-outcomes.json`

This report does not add runtime bridges, does not call real LLM providers,
real MCP servers, real skill registries, Qdrant, embeddings, or external
services, and does not update the overall NodeJS backend migration percentage.

## Layer Rules

| Layer | Meaning for this audit | Counting rule |
|---|---|---|
| `runtime` | Python executes a bounded runtime operation directly or through the Node-to-Python route under test. | Counts toward SlideRule V5 95 only for the named bounded capability. |
| `production-wiring smoke` | Python-side wiring reaches storage, vector, observability, or degraded production boundary semantics without real external dependency calls. | Counts as maturity support, not as real production takeover. |
| `contract-only` | Request, response, error, or envelope shape is stable. | Does not count as runtime closure by itself. |
| `proxy-only` | Node forwards a bounded operation to Python but Python ownership is not proved. | Does not count as runtime closure by itself. |
| `docs-only` | Status, inventory, or audit text improves the denominator. | Does not count as runtime or production completion. |

## Queue And Gate Posture

| Slice | Queue status from `../../.agent-loop/queue-outcomes.json` | Current HEAD gate evidence | Audit posture |
|---|---|---|---|
| `backend-python-mcp-call-real-runtime` | `DONE_REVIEWED` / `done` | `slide-rule-python/tests/test_mcp_call_real_runtime.py` | Count as bounded `runtime`. |
| `backend-python-skill-invoke-real-runtime` | `DONE_REVIEWED` / `done` | `slide-rule-python/tests/test_skill_invoke_real_runtime.py` | Count as bounded `runtime`. |
| `backend-python-orchestrate-plan-runtime-route` | `DONE_REVIEWED` / `done` | `slide-rule-python/tests/test_orchestrate_plan_runtime_route.py`; `server/routes/__tests__/sliderule.orchestrate-plan-python-runtime.test.ts` | Count as bounded `runtime`. |
| `backend-python-orchestrate-plan-state-projection` | `DONE_REVIEWED` / `done` | `slide-rule-python/tests/test_orchestrate_plan_state_projection.py`; `server/routes/__tests__/sliderule.orchestrate-plan-state-projection.test.ts` | Count as bounded runtime projection evidence, with Node still owning state mutation. |
| `backend-python-real-vector-retrieval-production-wiring` | `HALT_HUMAN` / `crashed` | `slide-rule-python/tests/test_real_vector_retrieval_production_wiring.py` | Count only as current HEAD `production-wiring smoke`; do not count as clean queue-completed production takeover. |
| `backend-python-rag-ingestion-production-storage` | `HALT_HUMAN` / `crashed` | `slide-rule-python/tests/test_rag_ingestion_production_storage.py`; `server/routes/__tests__/rag-ingestion-python-production-storage.test.ts` | Count only as current HEAD `production-wiring smoke`; do not count as clean queue-completed production storage migration. |
| LLM cost and circuit breaker support | `backend-python-llm-cost-runtime-accounting` and `backend-python-llm-circuit-breaker-parity` are `DONE_REVIEWED` / `done` | Status docs describe Python `sliderule_llm` support for cost accounting, pool, fallback, observability, and circuit breaker. | Count as supporting backend maturity, not as a direct SlideRule V5 runtime handoff in this 95 gate. |

## Capability Evidence Matrix

| Capability | Current HEAD evidence | Current class | Counts into SlideRule V5 95? | Missing path or production gap | Risk |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `mcp.call` | `test_mcp_call_real_runtime.py` exercises a Python MCP runtime adapter, permission check, success provenance, permission denial, and adapter-unavailable errors. `docs/backend-python-node-route-inventory-90.md` classifies `/api/mcp`, `/api/skills`, and SlideRule capability calls as `contract`, `runtime`. | `runtime` | Yes, as bounded runtime evidence. | No real external MCP server is called. Production authorization, tool orchestration, registry ownership, and long-running external MCP health are not proved. | Medium |
| `skill.invoke` | `test_skill_invoke_real_runtime.py` exercises an injectable `SkillRuntimeAdapter` with success payload preservation, not-found, denied, and runtime-error classifications. | `runtime` | Yes, as bounded runtime evidence. | No real skill registry or external skill execution service is called. Production registry ownership, authz, and tool-side effects remain out of scope. | Medium |
| `orchestrate.plan` Python route | `test_orchestrate_plan_runtime_route.py` verifies `/api/sliderule/orchestrate-plan` returns a contract-compatible Python planning shape. `sliderule.orchestrate-plan-python-runtime.test.ts` verifies the Node `/api/sliderule/execute-capability` route delegates through the real Node-to-Python HTTP route when `SLIDERULE_V5_BACKEND=python`, avoids Node LLM calls, forwards runtime input, and preserves delegated-failed semantics on Python errors. | `runtime` | Yes, as a bounded route runtime. | It does not prove full production planner ownership, long-running external LLM health, or replacement of every Node fallback map/session shell. | Low |
| `orchestrate.plan` state projection | `test_orchestrate_plan_state_projection.py` verifies `planStateProjection` shapes for partial, complete, and error states, including `stateAuthority: node`, `stateMutation: none`, selected steps, risks, and recovery points. `sliderule.orchestrate-plan-state-projection.test.ts` validates the Python projection through shared plan validation and rejects an error projection masquerading as complete success. | `runtime` projection evidence | Yes, as read-side state projection evidence. | Node remains the state authority and owns mutation. This is not full Blueprint or SlideRule state-machine migration. | Medium |
| `orchestrate.plan` error recovery | The 95 gate-visible evidence covers delegated route errors and explicit error projection/recovery shape. Earlier 90 docs also keep orchestrate route/runtime evidence separate from broader route shell ownership. | `runtime` error-boundary support | Yes, for bounded error semantics only. | The 95 gate does not prove every production recovery path, retry policy, or full planner resume flow. | Medium |
| Evidence and vector retrieval | `test_real_vector_retrieval_production_wiring.py` verifies disabled-by-default vector config, configured Qdrant-style URL/header/timeout construction through fake transport, retrieved provenance on hit, safe fallback on miss or vector unavailable, and no embedding or transport calls when disabled. `docs/backend-python-node-route-inventory-90.md` tags RAG/vector surfaces as `runtime`, `production-wiring` with smoke/degraded caveats. | `production-wiring smoke` | Yes, as evidence/vector maturity support for SlideRule V5 95. | It explicitly does not connect to real Qdrant or real embedding service. Queue status is still `HALT_HUMAN`/`crashed`, so this cannot be counted as clean queue-completed production takeover. | Medium-High |
| RAG ingestion and storage | `test_rag_ingestion_production_storage.py` verifies memory-backed ingest/chunk/upsert/delete paths, adapter-attempt reporting, explicit fake-memory provenance, `migratedStorage` shape, and unavailable storage failure without success payload. `rag-ingestion-python-production-storage.test.ts` verifies Node route status mapping for unavailable and failed storage. | `production-wiring smoke` | Yes, as RAG/storage boundary smoke for SlideRule V5 95. | It explicitly avoids Qdrant, embeddings, and external storage. Memory storage and fake production wiring must not be described as real production storage migration. Queue status is still `HALT_HUMAN`/`crashed`. | Medium-High |
| LLM pool, cost, and circuit breaker guard | `agent-loop/tasks/sliderule-python-migration-status.md` says Python `sliderule_llm` supports chat, JSON hardening, pool, fallback, telemetry metadata, vector client, stream contract, cost accounting, circuit breaker, and multimodal contract. Queue outcomes show cost accounting and circuit breaker parity as `DONE_REVIEWED` / `done`. | Supporting maturity, not direct 95 gate runtime | Only as supporting backend maturity. It should not be counted as a direct production handoff in this SlideRule V5 runtime closure gate. | Real production billing, external provider stability, cross-backend observability, key rotation, and long-running pool behavior remain outside this gate. | Medium |

## What Counts Toward The SlideRule V5 95 Closure

The following evidence can be counted toward a SlideRule V5 subsystem 95-stage
runtime closure statement:

- `mcp.call` has bounded Python runtime evidence for success, permission
  denial, and adapter error semantics.
- `skill.invoke` has bounded Python runtime evidence for success, not-found,
  denied, and runtime error semantics.
- `orchestrate.plan` has a current Node-to-Python runtime route test and a
  Python route test for contract-compatible output.
- `orchestrate.plan` state projection has explicit partial, complete, and error
  projection shapes, while preserving `stateAuthority: node` and
  `stateMutation: none`.
- Evidence/vector retrieval has production-wiring smoke for configured
  Qdrant-style runtime construction, retrieved provenance, and safe fallback.
- RAG ingestion has production-wiring smoke for storage success/failure
  envelopes and Node route status mapping.
- LLM pool/cost/circuit-breaker work supports the maturity story but remains
  separate from the direct `slideruleV5RuntimeClosureAudit95Gates`.

## What Must Not Be Counted

The following evidence must not be promoted into a stronger claim:

- Do not count the current worktree-local `.agent-loop/queue-outcomes.json`;
  that file is absent in this worktree.
- Do not count vector or RAG production-storage rows as clean queue-completed
  tasks; queue outcomes still show `HALT_HUMAN` / `crashed` for those rows.
- Do not describe fake transport, fake provider, synthetic smoke, or memory
  storage as real production service ownership.
- Do not describe disabled vector runtime fallback as successful vector
  production readiness.
- Do not describe `stateAuthority: node` / `stateMutation: none` projection as
  Python ownership of the full state machine.
- Do not count docs-only artifacts, route inventory, or status refresh text as
  runtime completion.
- Do not extrapolate this SlideRule V5 subsystem 95 posture to the entire
  NodeJS backend migration. The overall backend remains governed by the
  migration status document's conservative 80-85 percent working band.

## 95-Stage Audit Conclusion

SlideRule V5 can be reported as a 95-stage runtime closure candidate only with
this bounded wording:

> SlideRule V5 main runtime-chain evidence is closed to the 95-stage audit
> threshold for the named runtime surfaces: `mcp.call`, `skill.invoke`,
> `orchestrate.plan` route delegation, `orchestrate.plan` state projection,
> evidence/vector retrieval smoke, RAG production-storage smoke, and LLM guard
> support. This is not a claim that the whole NodeJS backend migration is 95
> percent complete, and it is not a claim that real external MCP, skill,
> Qdrant, embedding, LLM, RAG storage, billing, or telemetry services have been
> production-taken over by Python.

The accepted closure label for this report is therefore:

- SlideRule V5 subsystem: `95` audit posture, bounded and evidence-scoped.
- Overall NodeJS backend migration: not updated by this task.
- Production external-service takeover: not proven by this task.
