# Backend Python Production Wiring Reality Check 95

## Scope

This report separates the current 95-stage production wiring evidence into:

- real or production-shaped wiring that is actually exercised in current `HEAD`
- degradable wiring with explicit safe-failure semantics
- fake or synthetic smoke that must not be promoted into real external service ownership
- missing production configuration or environment validation

It is evidence-only. It does not call real Qdrant, embedding, search, OCR,
vision, audio, APM, billing, deployment, or other external services. It also
does not update the overall NodeJS-to-Python migration percentage.

Current baseline:

- Worktree: `.worktrees/migration-queue`
- Worktree-local `.agent-loop/queue-outcomes.json`: missing
- Status context fallback: `../../.agent-loop/queue-outcomes.json`
- Report target: production wiring reality 95

## Classification Rules

| Class | Meaning | Counting rule |
|---|---|---|
| `real wiring shape` | Current code builds a production-style runtime boundary, URL, headers, auth key, timeout, contract, or route path. | Counts as production wiring evidence only for the named boundary. |
| `degradable wiring` | Failure states remain visible as fallback, unavailable, degraded, unknown, or misconfigured. | Counts as safe-failure maturity, not as healthy production. |
| `fake/synthetic smoke` | Tests use fake transports, fake providers, memory storage, local fake services, or synthetic telemetry. | Counts as smoke or bounded runtime only. It is not real external service takeover. |
| `missing config` | Required external credentials, endpoints, stores, or deployment environments are absent or intentionally not used. | Must not be written as healthy or complete. |
| `external production gap` | Real Qdrant, embeddings, search, OCR, vision, audio, APM, billing, storage, or deployment needs live validation. | Does not count as production completion. |

## Evidence Matrix

| Capability | Evidence | Current posture | Safe-failure semantics | Remaining production gap |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Real vector retrieval | `slide-rule-python/tests/test_real_vector_retrieval_production_wiring.py`; status context says `backend-python-real-vector-retrieval-production-wiring` is `HALT_HUMAN` / `crashed`, while current `HEAD` has gate-visible tests. | `real wiring shape` plus `fake/synthetic smoke`. The test constructs Qdrant-style URL/header/timeout calls through `FakeTransport` and `FakeEmbeddingProvider`; it does not connect to Qdrant or real embeddings. | Disabled runtime returns fallback without embedding or transport calls. Empty result returns `fallbackReason: no_retrieval_hits`. Transport unavailable returns `fallbackReason: vector_unavailable:VectorClientUnavailable`. | Needs real Qdrant endpoint, real API key, real collection, real embedding provider, dimension compatibility, live timeout behavior, long-running retrieval quality, and production observability. |
| RAG ingestion production storage | `slide-rule-python/tests/test_rag_ingestion_production_storage.py`; `server/routes/__tests__/rag-ingestion-python-production-storage.test.ts`; status context says `backend-python-rag-ingestion-production-storage` is `HALT_HUMAN` / `crashed`, while current `HEAD` has gate-visible tests. | `fake/synthetic smoke` with a production-storage contract shape. Python uses `MemoryRAGIngestionStorageAdapter`; Node accepts the Python-shaped result and maps failure status. | Unavailable storage returns `status: unavailable`, HTTP 503, `migratedStorage: false`, a dead-letter record, and no fallback success payload. Failed storage returns HTTP 500 and no success payload. | Needs real vector/storage backend, real embeddings, durable RAG storage, object/document persistence, delete/upsert semantics against production data, retry policy, and operational monitoring. |
| Web AIGC search | `docs/backend-python-web-aigc-runtime-evidence-reconcile-88.md`; `docs/backend-python-web-aigc-longtail-inventory-89.md`; `slide-rule-python/tests/test_web_aigc_search_runtime_bridge.py`; `server/routes/__tests__/web-aigc.search-python-runtime.test.ts`. | Bounded `fake-provider runtime`, not external search production takeover. Tests assert `provider: fake` and `externalCalls: false` across web/image/graph/static-page shapes. | Empty/error responses preserve fake provenance and degraded/error envelopes instead of calling external fetch providers. | Needs real web search, image search, graph search, static page fetch, provider credentials, rate limits, abuse controls, provenance, and production network validation. Long-tail routes such as Web QA remain node-only inventory items. |
| Web AIGC file | `docs/backend-python-web-aigc-runtime-evidence-reconcile-88.md`; `slide-rule-python/tests/test_web_aigc_file_runtime_bridge.py`; `server/routes/__tests__/web-aigc.file-python-runtime.test.ts`. | Bounded memory/fake runtime. It proves Python can project file-generation, slicing, translation, Excel, and long-text envelopes without external services. | Fake runtime errors remain visible, provenance is `provider: fake`, and runtime context keeps `externalCalls: false`. | Needs real file persistence, artifact storage, translators, safe user path IO, storage cleanup, malware/content checks, and production-scale document handling. |
| Web AIGC vision/audio | `docs/backend-python-web-aigc-runtime-evidence-reconcile-88.md`; `slide-rule-python/tests/test_web_aigc_vision_audio_runtime_bridge.py`; `server/routes/__tests__/web-aigc.vision-audio-python-runtime.test.ts`. | Bounded fake media runtime. OCR, vision, STT, TTS, and audio tests keep fake provider metadata and no external calls. | Fake vision/audio errors are carried as explicit error codes; fake runtime results keep Python provenance and stable local success. | Needs real OCR, vision, multimodal, speech-to-text, text-to-speech, audio provider credentials, provider-specific safety handling, latency budgets, and production billing controls. |
| Telemetry production sink | `slide-rule-python/tests/test_telemetry_production_sink.py`; `server/routes/__tests__/telemetry-python-production-sink.test.ts`; `docs/backend-python-runtime-evidence-reconcile-89.md`. | `synthetic production-wiring smoke`, not real APM or billing emission. Tests assert `externalEmit: false`, `externalMonitoringRequest: false`, and `externalSink: false`. | Missing config stays `misconfigured`; timeout and unhealthy stay `degraded`; unknown stays `unknown`; all non-delivered states keep `delivery.emitted: false`. Contract tests reject degraded or unknown states masquerading as delivered. | Needs real OTLP/Datadog/APM/billing endpoints, credentials, network policy, delivery retry semantics, retention/export, and cross-service correlation. |
| Audit sink maturity | `docs/backend-python-runtime-evidence-reconcile-89.md` cites `slide-rule-python/services/audit_sink.py`, `slide-rule-python/tests/test_audit_production_sink.py`, and `server/tests/audit-production-sink.test.ts`. | Bounded audit production-sink smoke exists outside this gate's direct test command. It supports backend maturity but is not part of this report's real external sink proof. | The referenced reconcile keeps audit sink as bounded production-wiring smoke and preserves remaining retention/export/anomaly/compliance gaps. | Needs real durable audit store, retention/export, anomaly/compliance workflows, permission audit hooks, external audit platform integration, and long-running health checks. |
| Observability rollup | `slide-rule-python/tests/test_production_observability_rollup.py`; `server/routes/__tests__/python-observability-rollup.test.ts`. | Synthetic rollup over health/error/telemetry/cost envelopes. No Datadog, OpenTelemetry collector, billing system, or production sink is contacted. | Degraded status is preserved. Unknown or missing metrics cannot be reported as healthy. External sink claims are rejected when `externalMonitoringRequest` or `externalSink` is true. | Needs real telemetry source, real cost/billing source, APM/OTLP integration, production dashboards, alert policy, and sustained deployment metrics. |
| Deployment live smoke | `slide-rule-python/tests/test_deployment_live_smoke_boundary.py`; `server/routes/__tests__/python-deployment-live-smoke.test.ts`. | `real wiring shape` for health/config/proxy boundary plus fake local service smoke. Node resolves Python base URL/internal key/timeout and can route to a local Python-shaped service. | Wrong internal key returns 403 before LLM/agent calls. Missing LLM config returns explicit 502. Planner timeout returns a degraded body with `error: planner_timeout`. Node health checks classify healthy, unhealthy, timeout, and misconfigured states visibly. | Needs real deployed Python service, real internal key management, real network/proxy path, live deployment environment, real LLM/provider chain, deployment observability, rollback policy, and production smoke on infrastructure. |

## What Supports SlideRule V5 95

The following production wiring evidence can support a bounded SlideRule V5 95
posture:

- Vector retrieval production wiring smoke shows Qdrant-style config,
  request construction, provenance on hits, and safe fallback on miss,
  unavailable, or disabled runtime.
- RAG ingestion production-storage smoke shows storage/upsert/delete envelopes,
  Node route status mapping, dead-letter information, and no fallback success
  when storage is unavailable or failed.
- Deployment live smoke proves the Python service boundary, internal-key
  check, Node-to-Python proxy config, health classification, and timeout
  degradation can be exercised without external side effects.

These items support SlideRule V5 95 only as bounded runtime or
production-wiring smoke. They do not prove real external dependency takeover.

## What Supports Backend Maturity Only

The following items support overall backend maturity but should not be counted
as real production completion:

- Web AIGC search/file/vision/audio fake runtimes. They prove Python runtime
  envelopes and Node bridge compatibility, not real external providers.
- Telemetry synthetic sink. It proves sink-state semantics, not real APM,
  OTLP, Datadog, or billing delivery.
- Observability rollup. It proves degraded/unknown/missing metrics are not
  coerced into healthy, not real monitoring deployment.
- Audit production sink references from the 89 reconcile. They are bounded
  smoke, not durable audit platform migration.
- Queue outcomes and docs. They are status context, not runtime proof by
  themselves.

## Evidence That Must Stay Negative Or Degraded

- Worktree-local `.agent-loop/queue-outcomes.json` is absent. This report uses
  `../../.agent-loop/queue-outcomes.json` only as status context.
- Current status context still shows older vector/RAG/Web AIGC/telemetry 60/75
  task rows with `HALT_HUMAN` / `crashed`; the later 90 production-wiring smoke
  and 88/89 reconciles describe what current `HEAD` can count, but those older
  rows must not be rewritten as clean queue-completed production takeover.
- Fake provider, fake transport, memory storage, local fake Python service,
  and synthetic sink evidence must not be called healthy external production.
- Missing config, timeout, unhealthy, unavailable, failed, unknown, and
  misconfigured states must remain visible and non-delivered where the tests
  require it.

## Missing Production Validation

The 95-stage production wiring reality still needs separate live-environment
validation for:

- Qdrant endpoint, API key, collection, dimension, timeout, and retrieval
  quality.
- Real embedding provider configuration, billing, latency, retry, and
  dimension compatibility.
- Real web search, image search, graph search, static page fetch, Web QA, and
  long-tail Web AIGC providers.
- Real file persistence, artifact store, translators, user path IO, OCR,
  vision, STT, TTS, audio, and multimodal providers.
- Real telemetry/APM/OTLP/Datadog/billing emission, dashboards, alerts, and
  retention/export behavior.
- Real audit sink retention, compliance export, anomaly reporting, and
  permission/audit hooks.
- Real deployment environment, network path, internal key rotation, rollback,
  health checks, and long-running smoke tests.

## Conclusion

The current production wiring reality at 95 is mixed:

- SlideRule V5 has enough bounded production wiring smoke for vector/RAG and
  deployment boundary claims at the subsystem 95 audit level.
- Web AIGC, telemetry, audit, observability, and deployment evidence improve
  backend maturity and safety semantics, but most of it is fake, synthetic,
  degraded, or local-only.
- No evidence in this task proves real external Qdrant, embedding, search,
  OCR, vision, audio, APM, billing, audit platform, or deployment environment
  production takeover by Python.

Therefore the safe wording is:

> The 95-stage evidence proves bounded production wiring and safe-failure
> semantics for named Python backend slices. It does not prove full production
> completion or real external service takeover.
