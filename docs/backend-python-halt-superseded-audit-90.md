# Backend Python HALT Superseded Audit 90

## Scope

This report audits current `backend-python-*` queue red/no-diff signals before any 90% migration status refresh. It does not change business code, does not modify `agent-loop/tasks/000-nodejs-to-python-migration-status.md`, and does not update the overall migration percentage.

Inputs checked:

- `C:\Users\wangchunji\Documents\cube-pets-office\.agent-loop\queue-outcomes.json`
- `agent-loop/tasks/backend-python-*.md`
- `docs/backend-python-node-route-inventory-75.md`
- current `git log --oneline` for backend Python task, server, and Python runtime paths

Current inventory from queue outcomes:

- `HALT_HUMAN`: 21
- `HALT_NO_CHANGES`: 3
- `HALT_APPLY_FAILED`: 1
- no-diff reviewed item: 1 `DONE_REVIEWED_NO_DIFF`

Classification rules:

- `superseded`: a later task, commit, or tests now cover the same capability more concretely.
- `still-open`: no later accepted evidence closes the item.
- `split-needed`: the failed task is too broad and should be re-opened as smaller 90% tasks.
- `docs-only`: the item is evidence/status/inventory work, not a business migration slice.

## Summary

| Classification | Count | Meaning |
|---|---:|---|
| `superseded` | 14 | Covered by later landed task, commit, or explicit evidence. |
| `still-open` | 6 | Should remain visible for later 90% work. |
| `split-needed` | 2 | Needs smaller follow-up tasks rather than one broad claim. |
| `docs-only` | 4 | Documentation or audit/status work; do not count as migration implementation. |

The old red-light panel is mixed. Several pre-90 red items were real queue failures at the time but are now covered by later landed slices. The active 90% queue still has real gaps in route inventory, runtime depth audit, session persistence evidence, production wiring smoke, and final migration status refresh.

## Current Red And No-Diff Items

| Task | Queue status | Classification | Evidence | 90% follow-up |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `backend-python-a2a-invoke-runtime-bridge` | `HALT_HUMAN` | `superseded` | Commit `7e34c2a9 feat(backend-python): add a2a invoke runtime bridge`; touched `server/routes/a2a.ts`, `server/routes/__tests__/a2a-python-invoke-runtime.test.ts`, `slide-rule-python/services/a2a_runtime.py`, `slide-rule-python/tests/test_a2a_invoke_runtime_bridge.py`. Task doc now says manual completion and gate green. | Stream boundary remains separate and is covered by `backend-python-a2a-stream-runtime-boundary-90`. |
| `backend-python-audit-event-runtime-boundary` | `HALT_HUMAN` | `superseded` | Commit `f43a65ee docs(agent-loop): mark permission and audit runtime tasks reviewed`; task doc has gate/review checklist checked. Earlier implementation evidence exists in `6d9194f8 Advance backend Python migration slices` for audit runtime tests. | Included in `backend-python-auth-permission-audit-runtime-90` evidence review. |
| `backend-python-auth-session-runtime-boundary` | `HALT_HUMAN` | `superseded` | Task doc has gate/review checklist checked; `6d9194f8 Advance backend Python migration slices` touched auth/session runtime-boundary test evidence. | Included in `backend-python-auth-permission-audit-runtime-90`; do not treat as full auth stack migration. |
| `backend-python-blueprint-brainstorm-contract` | `HALT_HUMAN` | `superseded` | Commit `314bdfc2 feat(backend-python): harden blueprint brainstorm contract fields`; commit `83970d23 docs(agent-loop): mark blueprint brainstorm contract reviewed`; evidence paths include `server/routes/__tests__/blueprint.brainstorm-python-contract.test.ts`, `shared/blueprint/brainstorm-contracts.ts`, and `slide-rule-python/tests/test_blueprint_brainstorm_contract.py`. | Runtime migration of the full Blueprint brainstorm state machine remains out of scope. |
| `backend-python-halt-superseded-audit-90` | `HALT_HUMAN` | `docs-only` | This task is the present audit. Previous run failed review because the report was missing. Evidence is this report plus the updated task file. | Must pass review before later status refresh can rely on it. |
| `backend-python-knowledge-admin-proxy-contract` | `HALT_NO_CHANGES` | `superseded` | Later runtime bridge commit `744e119e feat(backend-python): add knowledge admin runtime bridge`; evidence paths include `server/routes/__tests__/knowledge-admin-python-runtime.test.ts`, `server/routes/knowledge-admin.ts`, `slide-rule-python/services/knowledge_admin_runtime.py`, and `slide-rule-python/tests/test_knowledge_admin_runtime_bridge.py`. | No longer count the proxy-contract no-diff as a new slice; count only the runtime bridge if status refresh accepts its evidence. |
| `backend-python-migration-status-refresh-45` | `HALT_NO_CHANGES` | `docs-only` | Task doc states manual closure after automatic `HALT_NO_CHANGES`; it explicitly kept the target as evidence-based progress, not a completed 45% fact. | Historical status-refresh artifact only; do not count as implementation. |
| `backend-python-migration-status-refresh-50` | `HALT_HUMAN` | `docs-only` | Task doc states manual takeover completed and warns against writing 50% as fact without evidence. | Historical status-refresh artifact only; do not count as implementation. |
| `backend-python-migration-status-refresh-60` | `HALT_HUMAN` | `docs-only` | Task doc states executed, gate/review checklist checked, and warns that 60% was not proven because no-diff items remained. | Historical status-refresh artifact only; do not count as implementation. |
| `backend-python-migration-status-refresh-90` | `HALT_HUMAN` | `still-open` | Queue outcome is still `HALT_HUMAN`. The task itself says it should run only after HALT audit, route inventory, runtime depth audit, and production smoke evidence are complete. | Re-run only after the prerequisite 90% evidence tasks land; this audit must not update percentages. |
| `backend-python-node-route-inventory-75` | `HALT_APPLY_FAILED` | `superseded` | `docs/backend-python-node-route-inventory-75.md` exists and documents route status buckets and counting rules; task doc checklist is checked. | Superseded as 75-stage inventory, but 90-stage route inventory is still open. |
| `backend-python-node-route-inventory-90` | `HALT_HUMAN` | `still-open` | Queue outcome is still `HALT_HUMAN`; task doc requires `docs/backend-python-node-route-inventory-90.md`, which is not part of this audit task. | Must create/review 90-stage route inventory before 90% status refresh. |
| `backend-python-permission-check-runtime-boundary` | `HALT_HUMAN` | `superseded` | Commit `61097ed0 feat(backend-python): add permission check runtime boundary`; commit `f43a65ee` marks reviewed; evidence paths include `server/permission/check-engine-python-runtime.test.ts`, `server/permission/check-engine.ts`, `shared/permission/contracts.ts`, and `slide-rule-python/tests/test_permission_check_runtime_boundary.py`. | Included in `backend-python-auth-permission-audit-runtime-90`. |
| `backend-python-permission-rate-limit-runtime-boundary` | `HALT_HUMAN` | `superseded` | Commit `f43a65ee` marks the task reviewed; `6d9194f8 Advance backend Python migration slices` contains rate-limit runtime-boundary evidence paths. | Included in `backend-python-auth-permission-audit-runtime-90`; verify no rate-limit relaxation in later review. |
| `backend-python-production-wiring-smoke-90` | `HALT_HUMAN` | `split-needed` | Queue outcome is still `HALT_HUMAN`. Some component evidence exists for RAG/search/deployment/observability, but the broad production smoke task includes vector, RAG, Web AIGC, telemetry, and deployment together. | Split into smaller smoke groups or re-run after file, vision/audio, telemetry sink, and deployment evidence are separately green. |
| `backend-python-rag-ingestion-production-storage` | `HALT_HUMAN` | `superseded` | Commit `36a6a4c5 feat(backend-python): add rag ingestion production storage boundary`; evidence paths include `server/routes/__tests__/rag-ingestion-python-production-storage.test.ts`, `shared/rag/contracts.ts`, `slide-rule-python/services/rag_ingestion.py`, `slide-rule-python/services/rag_service.py`, and `slide-rule-python/tests/test_rag_ingestion_production_storage.py`. | Production external dependencies still require smoke/observability evidence; do not call this full production RAG. |
| `backend-python-real-vector-retrieval-production-wiring` | `HALT_HUMAN` | `superseded` | Commit `36a6a4c5` also touched `agent-loop/tasks/backend-python-real-vector-retrieval-production-wiring.md`; task doc checklist says production wiring/fallback/provenance and gate/review are checked. | Remains supporting evidence for production wiring smoke, not proof of real external vector service availability. |
| `backend-python-session-persistence-runtime-boundary` | `DONE_REVIEWED_NO_DIFF` | `still-open` | Queue outcome is `DONE_REVIEWED_NO_DIFF` with `applyErrorKind=NO_DIFF_BASELINE_GREEN`; task doc checklist still has unchecked runtime items. | Feed `backend-python-session-persistence-runtime-diff-90`; decide whether to accept as existing capability review or require a real diff. |
| `backend-python-session-persistence-runtime-diff-90` | `HALT_HUMAN` | `still-open` | Queue outcome is still `HALT_HUMAN`; the task is explicitly meant to resolve the no-diff persistence boundary. | Must be handled before claiming the no-diff item is closed. |
| `backend-python-task-executor-proxy-contract` | `HALT_NO_CHANGES` | `superseded` | Later runtime bridge commit `8d465116 feat(backend-python): add task executor runtime bridge`; evidence paths include `server/tests/executor-client-python-runtime.test.ts`, `slide-rule-python/services/task_executor_runtime.py`, and `slide-rule-python/tests/test_task_executor_runtime_bridge.py`. | Do not count the proxy-contract no-diff as new delivery; only the runtime bridge has landed evidence. |
| `backend-python-telemetry-production-sink` | `HALT_HUMAN` | `split-needed` | Task doc checklist has gate/review checked, but current `git log` for the named telemetry sink test paths does not show a later dedicated telemetry sink commit beyond older migration-slice history. `backend-python-production-wiring-smoke-90` also remains `HALT_HUMAN`. | Keep as production-wiring follow-up; split sink adapter evidence from broad smoke if needed. |
| `backend-python-web-aigc-file-runtime-bridge` | `HALT_HUMAN` | `still-open` | Task doc checklist is still unchecked. Current commit evidence shows adapter contract (`6f3a6b17`) but not a landed runtime bridge. | Re-run as a bounded Web AIGC file runtime bridge task. |
| `backend-python-web-aigc-node-adapter-inventory` | `HALT_HUMAN` | `superseded` | Commit `5d51a88c docs(agent-loop): inventory web aigc node adapters`; later Web AIGC runtime/contract commits cover individual adapters. | Inventory is historical; runtime gaps remain per adapter. |
| `backend-python-web-aigc-search-runtime-bridge` | `HALT_HUMAN` | `superseded` | Commit `3a7791c9 feat(backend-python): add web aigc search runtime bridge`; evidence paths include `server/routes/__tests__/web-aigc.search-python-runtime.test.ts`, `slide-rule-python/services/web_aigc_search_adapter.py`, and `slide-rule-python/tests/test_web_aigc_search_runtime_bridge.py`. | Search bridge can support production wiring smoke, but real external search remains out of scope. |
| `backend-python-web-aigc-vision-audio-runtime-bridge` | `HALT_HUMAN` | `still-open` | Task doc checklist is still unchecked. Current evidence shows `e097c095 feat(backend-python): add web aigc vision audio contract`, not a landed runtime bridge. | Re-run as a bounded fake multimodal runtime bridge; do not call contract completion runtime migration. |
| `backend-python-workflow-staged-execution-runtime` | `HALT_HUMAN` | `superseded` | The lower-level workflow runtime contract landed in `e433b2cd feat(backend-python): add workflow runtime contract`; the staged-execution runtime task remains broader than the landed contract. | Treat the old red as superseded by contract-level coverage only; a later runtime-depth audit must not count this as full staged execution migration. |

## Still-Open 90% Gaps

The following items should feed later 90% work and must not be counted as completed by this audit:

| Gap | Why it remains open |
|---|---|
| `backend-python-node-route-inventory-90` | 90-stage route/core/task/auth/permission/audit/Blueprint/Web AIGC/A2A inventory is still missing from this task scope. |
| `backend-python-session-persistence-runtime-boundary` / `backend-python-session-persistence-runtime-diff-90` | The current item is no-diff reviewed; it still needs either a real runtime diff or explicit accepted existing-capability evidence. |
| `backend-python-web-aigc-file-runtime-bridge` | Only file adapter contract evidence is visible; runtime bridge checklist remains unchecked. |
| `backend-python-web-aigc-vision-audio-runtime-bridge` | Contract exists, but runtime bridge checklist remains unchecked. |
| `backend-python-telemetry-production-sink` | Needs clearer sink-specific production evidence instead of broad status text. |
| `backend-python-production-wiring-smoke-90` | Too broad to close while component runtime gaps remain. |
| `backend-python-migration-status-refresh-90` | Must wait for the audit, route inventory, runtime-depth audit, session/no-diff decision, and production smoke evidence. |

## Counting Notes

- `HALT_NO_CHANGES` is not a new migration delivery.
- `HALT_APPLY_FAILED` is not implementation completion, even if a related report exists.
- `DONE_REVIEWED_NO_DIFF` is only evidence review unless a later task accepts it explicitly.
- `DONE_REVIEWED` without commit, code path, test path, or current task evidence is not counted as implementation here.
- Contract/proxy evidence is not production runtime evidence.
- This report does not change any total migration percentage.
