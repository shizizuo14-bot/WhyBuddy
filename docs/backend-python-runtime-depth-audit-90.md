# Backend Python Runtime Depth Audit 90

## Scope

This audit reviews the current 75-candidate backend slices that are marked
`DONE_REVIEWED` in the migration status and queue planning files. It is a depth
audit only. It does not update the total migration percentage and it does not
turn contract or proxy evidence into runtime completion.

Sources checked:

- `agent-loop/scripts/migration-queue.json`
- `agent-loop/tasks/sliderule-python-migration-status.md`
- `docs/backend-python-node-route-inventory-75.md`
- `docs/backend-python-node-route-inventory-90.md`
- `docs/backend-python-halt-superseded-audit-90.md`
- the per-slice task files under `agent-loop/tasks/backend-python-*.md`

## Layer Rules

| Layer | Counting rule for 90 runtime depth |
|---|---|
| `contract-only` | Do not count as runtime completion. It can support schema/envelope confidence only. |
| `proxy-only` | Do not count as runtime completion. It proves a Node-to-Python forwarding boundary, not Python ownership. |
| `runtime-bridge` | Count as bounded runtime evidence when Node delegates a real scoped operation to Python and tests cover errors. |
| `production-wiring` | Count as production-readiness evidence when storage, health, observability, or deployment boundaries are explicitly tested. |

`production-wiring` rows in this report are maturity support, not proof that the
whole business route family is migrated. Docs-only and no-diff rows are listed
for exclusion but are not backend runtime slices.

## Audited DONE_REVIEWED Backend Slices

Audited rows: 15 current 75-candidate backend slices with `DONE_REVIEWED`.

| Slice | Layer | Count toward 90 runtime/prod evidence? | Evidence | Boundary note |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `backend-python-task-executor-runtime-bridge` | `runtime-bridge` | Yes, as bounded executor runtime bridge. | Task checklist is complete; queue config uses `taskExecutorRuntimeBridgeGates`; commit evidence in status is `8d465116`; evidence paths include `slide-rule-python/services/task_executor_runtime.py`, `slide-rule-python/tests/test_task_executor_runtime_bridge.py`, and `server/tests/executor-client-python-runtime.test.ts`. | Counts only the executor client start/status/cancel/read/error bridge. The task route, mission store, and production task lifecycle remain Node-owned. |
| `backend-python-knowledge-admin-runtime-bridge` | `runtime-bridge` | Yes, as bounded knowledge admin runtime bridge. | Task checklist is complete; queue config uses `knowledgeAdminRuntimeBridgeGates`; status evidence cites commit `744e119e`; evidence paths include `slide-rule-python/services/knowledge_admin_runtime.py`, `slide-rule-python/tests/test_knowledge_admin_runtime_bridge.py`, and `server/routes/__tests__/knowledge-admin-python-runtime.test.ts`. | Counts list/get/upsert/delete runtime delegation. It intentionally does not touch production knowledge storage, ingestion, embedding, or vector rebuilds. |
| `backend-python-blueprint-main-state-runtime-boundary` | `contract-only` | No. | Task checklist is complete, but the allowed files and gate are contract-focused: `slide-rule-python/tests/test_blueprint_main_state_contract.py` and `server/routes/__tests__/blueprint.main-state-python-contract.test.ts`; the 90 route inventory tags Blueprint main state as `contract`. | It fixes state projection and error boundary contracts. The Blueprint route shell, state machine, job lifecycle, and event bus remain Node-owned. |
| `backend-python-blueprint-job-runtime-proxy` | `proxy-only` | No. | Task checklist is complete; evidence paths include `slide-rule-python/services/blueprint_job_runtime.py`, `slide-rule-python/tests/test_blueprint_job_runtime_proxy.py`, and `server/routes/__tests__/blueprint.job-runtime-python-proxy.test.ts`. | Proves start/status/cancel/read proxy shape. It does not replace the Node job store, job lifecycle, or stream/event ownership. |
| `backend-python-blueprint-stage-edit-proxy-contract` | `proxy-only` | No. | Task checklist is complete; evidence paths include `slide-rule-python/tests/test_blueprint_stage_edit_proxy_contract.py` and `server/routes/__tests__/blueprint.stage-edit-python-proxy.test.ts`. | Covers validate/preview, accepted/rejected/conflict/noop, and staleness field preservation. Node still owns invalidation and main state mutation. |
| `backend-python-role-runtime-proxy-contract` | `proxy-only` | No. | Task checklist is complete; evidence paths include `slide-rule-python/services/role_runtime.py`, `slide-rule-python/tests/test_role_runtime_proxy_contract.py`, `server/routes/blueprint/role-agent-runtime/python-proxy.ts`, and `server/routes/__tests__/blueprint.role-runtime-python-proxy.test.ts`. | The proxy contract covers invoke/progress/callback/error and trace sanitizing. Real role-agent execution, callbacks, tools, and production LLM/tool dependencies remain mixed or Node-led. |
| `backend-python-nl-command-runtime-contract` | `contract-only` | No. | Task checklist is complete; evidence paths include `slide-rule-python/services/nl_command_runtime.py`, `slide-rule-python/tests/test_nl_command_runtime_contract.py`, and `server/routes/__tests__/nl-command-python-runtime-contract.test.ts`. | Locks analyze/clarify/plan/approval/report envelopes and permission denial semantics. It does not execute real commands or migrate full orchestration. |
| `backend-python-workflow-runtime-contract` | `contract-only` | No. | Task checklist is complete; evidence paths include `slide-rule-python/services/workflow_runtime.py`, `slide-rule-python/tests/test_workflow_runtime_contract.py`, `server/routes/__tests__/workflow-python-runtime-contract.test.ts`, and shared workflow contracts. | Covers graph/run/node-result/error shape. Staged production execution and task dispatch are separate runtime work. |
| `backend-python-rag-ingestion-runtime-contract` | `contract-only` | No. | Task checklist is complete; evidence paths include `slide-rule-python/tests/test_rag_ingestion_runtime_contract.py` and `server/routes/__tests__/rag-ingestion-python-runtime-contract.test.ts`; the task explicitly excludes real Qdrant and embedding providers. | This is fake/bounded ingestion runtime contract evidence. Production storage, real vector retrieval, and external embedding readiness are separate production-wiring slices. |
| `backend-python-telemetry-route-contract` | `contract-only` | No. | Task checklist is complete; evidence paths include `slide-rule-python/services/telemetry_runtime.py`, `slide-rule-python/tests/test_telemetry_route_contract.py`, and `server/routes/__tests__/telemetry-python-route-contract.test.ts`. | Locks metrics/events/cost/error contracts and synthetic/estimated/actual fields. It is not a production telemetry sink. |
| `backend-python-a2a-runtime-contract` | `contract-only` | No. | Task checklist is complete; evidence paths include `slide-rule-python/services/a2a_runtime.py`, `slide-rule-python/tests/test_a2a_runtime_contract.py`, and `server/routes/__tests__/a2a-python-runtime-contract.test.ts`. | Covers invoke/stream chunk/cancel/list agents envelopes. It does not prove stream runtime bridge or real external agent production execution. |
| `backend-python-blueprint-artifact-memory-proxy` | `proxy-only` | No. | Task checklist is complete; evidence paths include `slide-rule-python/tests/test_blueprint_artifact_memory_proxy.py` and `server/routes/__tests__/blueprint.artifact-memory-python-proxy.test.ts`. | Covers read/write/list/error proxy shape only. Real artifact memory store remains Node-owned. |
| `backend-python-blueprint-review-export-proxy` | `proxy-only` | No. | Task checklist is complete; evidence paths include `slide-rule-python/tests/test_blueprint_review_export_proxy.py` and `server/routes/__tests__/blueprint.review-export-python-proxy.test.ts`. | Covers review/export proxy and permission/error shape only. It does not migrate export authority, UI, or production artifact generation. |
| `backend-python-deployment-live-smoke-boundary` | `production-wiring` | Yes, as deployment/live-smoke maturity support only. | Task checklist is complete; status evidence cites commit `9164c86f`; queue config uses `deploymentLiveSmokeBoundaryGates`; the 90 route inventory references `server/routes/__tests__/python-deployment-live-smoke.test.ts` and `slide-rule-python/tests/test_deployment_live_smoke_boundary.py`. | Counts health/config/live-smoke visibility. It is not a full end-to-end production route migration. |
| `backend-python-production-observability-rollup` | `production-wiring` | Yes, as production observability maturity support only. | Task checklist is complete; status evidence cites commit `923bd432`; queue config uses `productionObservabilityRollupGates`; evidence paths include `slide-rule-python/tests/test_production_observability_rollup.py`, `server/routes/__tests__/python-observability-rollup.test.ts`, and shared telemetry contracts. | Counts degraded/unknown/error/cost rollup readiness. It does not connect an external APM or replace route-specific production sinks. |

## Excluded Current 75-Candidate Rows

| Row | Status | Classification | Why it is not counted |
|---|---|---|---|
| `backend-python-session-persistence-runtime-boundary` | `DONE_REVIEWED_NO_DIFF` | no-diff review, effectively contract-only until accepted | The task checklist remains unchecked and the HALT audit says it must feed `backend-python-session-persistence-runtime-diff-90`. It is not a new runtime diff. |
| `backend-python-node-route-inventory-75` | `HALT_APPLY_FAILED` | docs-only inventory evidence | Route inventory is useful denominator evidence, but it is not backend runtime implementation. |
| `backend-python-migration-status-refresh-75` | `DONE_REVIEWED` | docs-only status refresh | Status refresh does not migrate a backend slice. It must not be counted in runtime completion. |

## Count Summary

Can count toward 90 runtime/prod evidence:

| Slice | Count type | Caveat |
|---|---|---|
| `backend-python-task-executor-runtime-bridge` | bounded business `runtime-bridge` | Executor client bridge only, not full task route lifecycle. |
| `backend-python-knowledge-admin-runtime-bridge` | bounded business `runtime-bridge` | In-memory/contract storage only, not production knowledge storage. |
| `backend-python-deployment-live-smoke-boundary` | `production-wiring` maturity support | Health/config boundary only. |
| `backend-python-production-observability-rollup` | `production-wiring` maturity support | Rollup/degraded visibility only, not external APM or all sinks. |

Cannot count as 90 runtime completion:

| Reason | Slices |
|---|---|
| `contract-only` | `backend-python-blueprint-main-state-runtime-boundary`, `backend-python-nl-command-runtime-contract`, `backend-python-workflow-runtime-contract`, `backend-python-rag-ingestion-runtime-contract`, `backend-python-telemetry-route-contract`, `backend-python-a2a-runtime-contract` |
| `proxy-only` | `backend-python-blueprint-job-runtime-proxy`, `backend-python-blueprint-stage-edit-proxy-contract`, `backend-python-role-runtime-proxy-contract`, `backend-python-blueprint-artifact-memory-proxy`, `backend-python-blueprint-review-export-proxy` |
| no-diff or docs-only | `backend-python-session-persistence-runtime-boundary`, `backend-python-node-route-inventory-75`, `backend-python-migration-status-refresh-75` |

## Required Follow-Up Runtime Or Production Wiring

| Gap | Current depth | Required next step before it can count as runtime/prod completion |
|---|---|---|
| Blueprint main state and route shell | `contract-only` | Add a bounded runtime bridge or production wiring for selected state operations; keep the full route shell, event bus, job store, ledgers, previews, prompt packages, and traceability separately audited. |
| Blueprint job runtime | `proxy-only` | Prove Python-owned bounded job runtime behavior beyond proxy shape, including lifecycle/error semantics that do not depend on Node job store ownership. |
| Blueprint stage edit | `proxy-only` | Add runtime bridge evidence for selected edits while preserving Node staleness/invalidation semantics. |
| Role runtime | `proxy-only` | Add real bounded role-agent runtime bridge, callback, tool, and authorization behavior without leaking prompts, keys, or tool outputs. |
| NL command | `contract-only` | Add runtime bridge evidence for analyze/clarify/plan/report with permission and audit guards. |
| Workflow | `contract-only` | Add staged execution runtime evidence; the HALT audit warns that the older staged-execution task was superseded only by contract-level coverage. |
| RAG ingestion | `contract-only` | Keep production storage, real vector retrieval, embedding fallback, provenance, and broad production smoke as separate production-wiring tasks. |
| Telemetry | `contract-only` | Add or re-run sink-specific production wiring; the 90 route inventory flags telemetry production sink evidence as still blocking broad production smoke. |
| A2A | `contract-only` | Keep invoke bridge separate from stream runtime; add stream runtime boundary and external-agent safe-failure evidence before counting production A2A. |
| Blueprint artifact memory and review/export | `proxy-only` | Add real store/export runtime bridge or production storage/permission wiring before counting these as runtime completion. |
| Session persistence | no-diff review | Resolve with `backend-python-session-persistence-runtime-diff-90`: either land a real diff or explicitly accept existing-capability evidence. |
