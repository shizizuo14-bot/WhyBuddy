/**
 * DERIVE P3 read-only guard — WhyBuddy V5.1 GOAL Conclusion Gate
 * Spec: .kiro/specs/whybuddy-goal-conclusion-gate/ (Task 3.3, Property 3 / P3)
 *
 * Pins the DERIVE read-only-on-STATE invariant (knife P3): `deriveNodeStatus(state)` MUST
 * change ONLY `graph.nodes[].status` and leave every authoritative STATE field deep-equal to
 * the input. The design / bugfix.md (criteria 2.5, 3.5) require this to be enforced by a
 * guard/test rather than by convention, so that a future regression that lets DERIVE write
 * `artifacts`, `goal`, `decisions`, `capabilityRuns`, gaps (`coverageGaps`) or ledgers
 * (`decisionLedger`) is caught loudly.
 *
 * This is a framework-agnostic dev/test guard: it throws a descriptive `Error` on any
 * violation (no vitest / fast-check dependency), so it can be used from the P3 preservation
 * test and from any future call site.
 *
 * Validates: Requirements 2.5, 3.5
