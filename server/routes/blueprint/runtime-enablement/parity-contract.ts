/**
 * Parity Contract — App (Track A) vs Skill (Track B) enforcement-model mapping.
 *
 * This is the machine-readable half of the `Parity_Contract` for the
 * `blueprint-trust-enforcement-model` spec. It maps each enforcement-relevant
 * node of the SlideRule v4 closed-loop diagram
 * (`docs/assets/SlideRuleArc/SlideRuleSkill闭环总图_改进版v4.md`) to the enforcement
 * model it uses in the App vs the Skill, the reason the two diverge, and the
 * concrete App / Skill artifacts that implement that node's enforcement.
 *
 * The companion human-readable document lives at
 * `.kiro/specs/blueprint-trust-enforcement-model/parity-contract.md`.
 *
 * ## The Red Line is data, not prose
 *
 * The {@link PARITY_CONTRACT}.`redLine` field below holds the single canonical,
 * verbatim Red Line string copied **unchanged** from the
 * Enforcement_Model_Decision_Record (ADR):
 * `.kiro/specs/blueprint-trust-enforcement-model/enforcement-model-decision-record.md`
 * (see the `CANONICAL-RED-LINE` block in that file). The `Parity_Guard_Test`
 * reads this exact string as its literal pass/fail criterion, so the constraint
 * flows ADR → Parity Contract → Guard Test and is enforced by CI rather than by
 * memory.
 *
 * This module is **data only**: it describes the intentional App=advisory /
 * Skill=hard-gate fork. It changes no runtime behavior, turns no gate on or off,
 * and never converts any advisory App gate into a blocking gate.
 *
 * @see design.md "Data Models" — `EnforcementModel`, `ParityNode`, `ParityContract`
 * @see .kiro/specs/blueprint-trust-enforcement-model/enforcement-model-decision-record.md
