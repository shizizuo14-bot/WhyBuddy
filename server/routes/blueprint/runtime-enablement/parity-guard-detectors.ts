/**
 * Parity Guard detectors — the pure scanning core of the `Parity_Guard_Test`
 * (blueprint-trust-enforcement-model, Task 6.1, Requirements 4.1–4.4).
 *
 * Two detectors live here, both pure functions of `(repoRoot, contract)`:
 *
 * 1. {@link detectMappingDrift} (Requirement 4.1) — for each node in the
 *    Parity Contract, assert the codebase reality matches the recorded mapping:
 *    the App env flag is a real member of `TRUST_GATE_ENABLEMENT_KEYS`, the App
 *    route / component exists on disk, and the Skill script exists under
 *    `skills/sliderule/sliderule/scripts/**`. Any mismatch is reported as a
 *    {@link DriftFinding} naming the drifted node id and unresolved artifact.
 *
 * 2. {@link detectRedLineViolations} (Requirement 4.2) — scan the App
 *    trust-surface sources (the 5 gate services named by the contract, plus the
 *    right-rail trust panels and `TrustSection.tsx`) for any phrase that asserts
 *    or implies the Skill's hard-gate / "agent-can't-touch" guarantee, using a
 *    denylist derived from the ADR's canonical concepts
 *    ({@link FORBIDDEN_APP_PHRASES}). Each match is reported as a
 *    {@link RedLineFinding} naming the file, phrase, line, and excerpt.
 *
 * The denylist is intentionally derived from the ADR (`The App must never
 * describe its own gates as a hard gate, as tamper-proof, or as a guarantee the
 * agent cannot touch or bypass`) and deliberately EXCLUDES the bare words
 * "block" and "never", so the App's legitimate advisory wording — e.g. "records
 * findings for human review and never auto-blocks" — is NOT flagged.
 *
 * This module is data/IO-read only. It changes no runtime behavior, turns no
 * gate on or off, and never converts an advisory App gate into a blocking gate.
 *
 * @see .kiro/specs/blueprint-trust-enforcement-model/enforcement-model-decision-record.md
 * @see ./parity-contract.ts — the contract these detectors compare against
