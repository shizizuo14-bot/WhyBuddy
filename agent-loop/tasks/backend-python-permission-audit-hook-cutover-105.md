# Backend Python 105: Permission audit hook cutover

## Execution status
- Status: pending
- Goal: Route permission and Web AIGC audit hooks through Python-owned audit/enforcement pipeline.
- Queue: `backend-python-total-cutover-105-queue`
- Phase: Permission Audit
- Sequence: 26 / 48

## Context
This task is part of the single-batch NodeJS-to-Python total cutover push. The intent is to reduce real Node business ownership, not to add another thin classification slice. Treat `agent-loop/tasks/000-nodejs-to-python-migration-status.md` as the current denominator map and use the 104 evidence as the baseline.

## Allowed files
- `agent-loop/tasks/000-nodejs-to-python-migration-status.md`
- `agent-loop/tasks/backend-python-permission-audit-hook-cutover-105.md`
- `server/index.ts`
- `server/permission/**`
- `server/audit/**`
- `server/routes/**`

## Evidence to read
- `agent-loop/tasks/000-nodejs-to-python-migration-status.md`
- `.agent-loop/queue-outcomes.json` when present
- `agent-loop/scripts/backend-python-total-cutover-105-queue.json`
- Previous 105 queue tasks 1-25 when their outputs are relevant.
- Existing Python and Node tests near the files listed above

## Required implementation
1. Create shared Python-first hook helper for permission/audit events.
2. Replace direct Node hook ownership in protected families.
3. Test hook metadata, denial audit, and fallback visibility.

## Required tests
- Add or update Python tests under `slide-rule-python/tests/` for the Python-owned behavior.
- Add or update Node/Vitest tests under `server/**/__tests__/` or `server/tests/` proving Node is a thin proxy or explicit retained compatibility shell.
- Run the smallest relevant Python and Node test commands and record them in the final task update.
- Keep or add a mojibake check for this task and every edited non-generated markdown/code file named by the queue gate.

## Do not
- Do not count docs-only, no-diff, skipped-live, synthetic, external-owned, or retained Node fallback as Python migration completion.
- Do not remove public API compatibility without a Node bridge or explicit frontend update.
- Do not hide Python failures behind silent Node success; degraded and fallback states must be visible.
- Do not edit unrelated frontend polish or AgentLoop dashboard layout unless the task explicitly names it.

## Acceptance criteria
- The task lands real Python-owned runtime, production wiring, frontend integration, or an executable cutover guard matching the goal.
- Tests prove the Python path is exercised and that Node no longer owns migrated business semantics.
- Any remaining Node behavior is named as thin proxy, compatibility shell, or explicitly retained boundary with a reason.
- The worker final report lists commands run, files changed, and whether the migration numerator can change.
