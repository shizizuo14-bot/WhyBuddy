# Backend NodeJS to Python migration: A2A stream runtime boundary 90

## Execution Status

- Status: reviewed by queue, reconciled by runtime evidence reconcile 88.
- Original goal: add minimal A2A stream runtime-boundary evidence without
  starting real external agents.
- Reconcile result: current `HEAD` supports A2A stream contract projection, not
  an independently visible stream runtime bridge.

### Reconciled Checklist

- [x] Queue outcome read:
  `backend-python-a2a-stream-runtime-boundary-90` is `DONE_REVIEWED`/`done` in
  `../../.agent-loop/queue-outcomes.json`.
- [x] Current `HEAD` file evidence checked.
- [x] Python A2A service projection is visible.
- [x] Python and Node A2A contract tests are visible.
- [x] Gate-named Python stream runtime test is missing in current `HEAD`.
- [x] Gate-named Node stream runtime test is missing in current `HEAD`.
- [x] Count posture corrected: A2A stream is `contract-only`, not runtime or
  production stream migration.
- [x] Gate from `runtimeEvidenceReconcile88Gates` passes after this reconcile.

## Current `HEAD` Evidence

Current `HEAD`:

- `66677676b941a0a923ea422bd22792d1d4f28cf6`
- `66677676 chore(agent-loop): plan backend python 88 queue`

Visible contract/service projection evidence:

- `slide-rule-python/services/a2a_runtime.py`
- `slide-rule-python/tests/test_a2a_runtime_contract.py`
- `server/routes/__tests__/a2a-python-runtime-contract.test.ts`
- `shared/a2a-protocol.ts`
- Commit evidence:
  - `3eca0bd4 feat(backend-python): add a2a runtime contract`
  - `7e34c2a9 feat(backend-python): add a2a invoke runtime bridge`

Visible Node-owned stream transport files:

- `server/routes/a2a.ts`
- `server/core/a2a-client.ts`
- `server/core/a2a-server.ts`

Missing stream runtime-boundary paths in current `HEAD`:

- `slide-rule-python/tests/test_a2a_stream_runtime_boundary.py`
- `server/routes/__tests__/a2a-python-stream-runtime.test.ts`

## Counting Posture

| Slice | Count posture |
|---|---|
| A2A stream contract projection | `contract-only`; not a stream runtime bridge. |
| A2A invoke/list/cancel projection | Covered by existing contract/service evidence; not proof of stream production migration. |
| Node stream transport | Node-owned behavior; not Python runtime/production evidence. |

This task must not be used to claim real CrewAI, LangGraph, Claude, external
agent execution, stream orchestration, registry persistence, or production A2A
stream migration.

## Allowed Files

- `slide-rule-python/services/a2a_runtime.py`
- `slide-rule-python/tests/test_a2a_stream_runtime_boundary.py`
- `slide-rule-python/tests/test_a2a_runtime_contract.py`
- `server/routes/a2a.ts`
- `server/core/a2a-client.ts`
- `server/core/a2a-server.ts`
- `server/routes/__tests__/a2a-python-stream-runtime.test.ts`
- `server/routes/__tests__/a2a-python-runtime-contract.test.ts`
- `shared/a2a-protocol.ts`
- `agent-loop/tasks/backend-python-a2a-stream-runtime-boundary-90.md`

## Boundaries

- No real CrewAI, LangGraph, Claude, or external agent startup.
- No full production stream orchestration migration.
- No agent registry persistence changes.
- No `.agent-loop` runtime artifacts committed.

## Original Gate

The original 90 gate key is `a2aStreamRuntimeBoundary90Gates`, but this
reconcile does not rerun it as proof because the stream runtime test paths are
absent in current `HEAD`.

The active gate for this repair is `runtimeEvidenceReconcile88Gates`.

## Success Criteria

- [x] Stream status/envelope contract evidence is listed only as
  `contract-only`.
- [x] Cancelled/error semantics are not promoted into completed status.
- [x] Missing runtime paths are explicitly marked.
- [x] No real external agent behavior is claimed.
