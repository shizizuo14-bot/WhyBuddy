# Backend Python 104: Migration status refresh

## Execution status
- Status: pending
- Goal: refresh `000-nodejs-to-python-migration-status.md` from the actual 104 queue outcomes, code diffs, gates, and review evidence.
- Required gate: `migrationStatusRefresh104Gates`

## Context
This is the 104 accounting task. It does not create business migration numerator by itself. It must only update progress if the preceding 104 tasks prove real Python-owned runtime takeover or formally remove surfaces from the migration denominator.

## Allowed files
- `agent-loop/tasks/000-nodejs-to-python-migration-status.md`
- This task file

## Evidence to read
- `.agent-loop/queue-outcomes.json`
- `.agent-loop/queue-landing.json`
- `agent-loop/scripts/migration-queue.json`
- `agent-loop/tasks/backend-python-*-104.md`
- Relevant 104 Python/Node service and test files
- Recent git commits for the 104 queue

## Do not
- Do not edit business code.
- Do not count this status refresh as migration progress.
- Do not write overall 100% unless all blockers are removed by real takeover or formal denominator exclusion.
- Do not count retained, skipped-live, external-owned, synthetic, docs-only, or no-diff work as Python migration completion.

## Acceptance criteria
- Status file has a 104 section with counted evidence and non-counted evidence.
- Overall working number only changes if evidence supports it.
- Remaining blockers are listed plainly.
- mojibake check passes.
