# Backend NodeJS to Python migration: auth permission audit runtime 90

## Execution Status

- Status: reviewed by queue, reconciled by runtime evidence reconcile 88.
- Original goal: move auth/session, permission check, rate limit, and audit
  event evidence from contract/boundary into runtime evidence where current
  `HEAD` can prove it.
- Reconcile result: mixed. Do not count this task as full auth, permission, or
  audit runtime/production migration.

### Reconciled Checklist

- [x] Queue outcome read:
  `backend-python-auth-permission-audit-runtime-90` is `DONE_REVIEWED`/`done`
  in `../../.agent-loop/queue-outcomes.json`.
- [x] Current `HEAD` file evidence checked.
- [x] Permission check runtime-boundary evidence is visible in current `HEAD`.
- [x] Auth/session runtime-boundary gate paths are missing in current `HEAD`.
- [x] Permission rate-limit runtime-boundary gate paths are missing in current
  `HEAD`.
- [x] Audit event runtime-boundary gate paths are missing in current `HEAD`.
- [x] Count posture corrected: only permission check is bounded
  `runtime-boundary`; auth/session, rate-limit, and audit event stay
  `contract-only` with runtime `evidence-missing`.
- [x] Gate from `runtimeEvidenceReconcile88Gates` passes after this reconcile.

## Current `HEAD` Evidence

Current `HEAD`:

- `shared/permission/contracts.ts`
- `slide-rule-python/middlewares/auth.py`
- Commit evidence: `61097ed0 feat(backend-python): add permission check runtime boundary`

Visible contract-only evidence:

- Contract commit evidence: `6d9194f8 Advance backend Python migration slices`

Missing runtime-boundary paths in current `HEAD`:

- `server/tests/auth-session-runtime-boundary.test.ts`
- `slide-rule-python/tests/test_permission_rate_limit_runtime_boundary.py`

## Counting Posture

| Slice | Count posture |
|---|---|
| Auth/session | `contract-only`; runtime evidence is `evidence-missing`. |
| Permission check | Bounded `runtime-boundary`; not full permission production migration. |
| Permission rate limit | `contract-only`; runtime evidence is `evidence-missing`. |
| Audit event | `contract-only`; runtime evidence is `evidence-missing`. |

This task must not be used to claim production schema migration, production
auth persistence, permission route management, audit sink/export/retention, or
overall backend migration progress at 90%.

## Boundaries

- No production database schema changes.
- No real IAM, OAuth provider, or external audit platform integration.
- No weakening of deny, rate-limit, or audit failure semantics.
- No `.agent-loop` runtime artifacts committed.

## Original Gate

The original 90 gate key is `authPermissionAuditRuntime90Gates`, but this
reconcile does not rerun it as proof because several gate-named runtime paths
are absent in current `HEAD`.

The active gate for this repair is `runtimeEvidenceReconcile88Gates`.

## Success Criteria

- [x] Runtime evidence is only counted where current `HEAD` has concrete paths.
- [x] Deny/error semantics are not promoted into success.
- [x] Contract fields remain available for future production wiring.
- [x] Missing runtime paths are explicitly marked and not counted as production.
