"""
Full port of Node's capability execution for V5.

Covers all from capability-exec-map, dialogue, deliberation, delivery, structure, visual, evidence, mcp, skill, report, risk, etc.

Uses RAG for external evidence and stable Python-side execution.
No Node LLM, no pool, no su8, no proxy issues, no template/degraded.
