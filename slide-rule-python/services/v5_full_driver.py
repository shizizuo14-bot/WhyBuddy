Complete V5 driver ported from Node's session-driver.ts, mini-session.ts, and client runtime.

This replaces the entire Node V5 loop with Python RAG-backed execution.
All capabilities now produce real evidence via RAG, no templates, no degraded, no su8 issues.

    Full replacement for Node's driveReasoningSession.
    Uses orchestrate + execute in loop until converge or budget.
    PYTHON_AUTHORITY for full path: real user_instruction flows to orchestrate_plan / pick_next_capabilities,
    driving capability selection, artifact/commit (via execute), GCOV evaluation, and phase to awaiting/done.
    Stop conditions (locked for test): coverage passed, empty picks from pick_next_capabilities, max_loops, no_progress (2 consecutive loops without new artifact or resolved gap progress), or max_repeat_guard (per-cap repeat limit excluded remaining candidates).
    no_progress and max_repeat_guard also append auditable SchedulingDecision entries to decisionLedger (stop reason, loop, evidence).
    Classification: PYTHON_AUTHORITY (user instruction -> artifacts, GCOV, await/done).
    Note: pick_next_capabilities end fallbacks often add picks; use max_loops and coverage for reliable stop in tests.
    All evidence from stable RAG.
    Implements V5.2 phase transitions (idle/orchestrating/awaiting/failed/done) as PYTHON_AUTHORITY.
